# Just my basic neovim configuration for Window :>.

## Installation

I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to install plugins.

There are 2 way to use this config:
1. Just copy what you need :>.
2. Clone the whole repo to your computer and copy all of it to `~Users\<your_computer_name>\AppData\Local\nvim\`. If you don't have `nvim` file, just create it :>. When it done, open `init.vim` by `nvim-qt.exe` and then type `:PlugInstall` in `Command` mode. Finally, save your `init.vim` and enjoy your new neovim :>.
